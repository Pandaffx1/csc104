        Hi there! My name is Panda, and I'm currently studying Computer Science
        at the University of Lagos(UNILAG).This website is a simple space where
        I share a bit about who I am, my journey into tech, and some of the projects
        I am working on as a student.

        This website was built as a part of my CSC 104 assignment using only HTML and 
        CSS. It's a small but meaningful step forward building my web development skills,
        and I'm excited to keep learning and improving.
