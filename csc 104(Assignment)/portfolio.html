                A simple app that lets student enter their grades and calculates
                their GPA instantly. I built using HTML forms and Javascript logic. 
                It's designed to help UNILAG students keep track of their results.

             This is the personal website you're on right now! I used HTML and CSS   
             to build it from scratch. It introduces me and shows all my projects and skills.

            This is a mock login page I designed for learning how forms work in HTML. It's 
            connected to any real backend, but it helped me understand form structure, validation, and security 
            basics.
