            I'm Panda, a Cybersecurity student at the University of 
            Lagos with a passion for technology, web development, and solving 
            real-world problems with code. I love exploring how things work and
            making ideas come to life through tech.

            I enjoy building websites with HTML and CSS. I'm also learning
            cybersecurity fundamentals and data analysis tools like SPSS. I'm working 
            on improving my Javascript and hope to build interactive websites soon.

                One of my first projects is this website you're reading! I created it using HTML
                and CSS to showcase my journey in tech. I'm currently learning how to add 
                interactivity with Javascript.
